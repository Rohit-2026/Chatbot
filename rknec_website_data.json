For an educational institution this hunger for excellence ensures constant improvement and it in itself is success. Every level of success brings change and the ability to accept and adapt to this propels one to the next level. The dynamic environment and the challenges that the world is facing today make it imperative for educational institutions to instill a sense of confidence in the youth. It is their responsibility to inculcate a strong sense of adherence towards values with a simultaneous pursuit for excellence. At RCOEM it will be our endeavor to create a generation that will question, research and establish the truth. RCOEM will strive to produce a generation of thinkers, planners, and implementers. A set of professionals with a vision to lead the world through change while keeping the values intact. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nShri Rajendra Purohit\nGeneral Secretary of RCOEM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShri Rajendra Purohit is Managing Director of the leading English daily \u2018The Hitavada\u2019 publishing from Nagpur, Jabalpur, Raipur and Bhopal.

Linguistic differences and cultural gaps among students also call for the setting up of placement cells. Availability of relevant and accessible information coupled with professional guidance to utilize the same can result in better career achievements outside the classrooms and help in the healthy progression of students.College is delivering relevant information on courses and combinations on offer with freedom of choice is generally available and counselling is informally given as a support service. The conventional information system comprises a copy of prospectus that contains a list of courses and combinations, entry rules, fee structure, examination schedule etc. in a routine repetitive manner year after year.But now with the change in scenario, not only the academic content and its rules have become oriented towards the market needs but one has also to address social disparities and career opportunities that education has to offer. The conventional information system is now to be supplemented with active guidance and information technology that is fast replacing the print media with a system that can quickly retrieve information details for the benefit of all concerned. Now it is important to institutionalize this support to enhance the reach and scope of available opportunities for the students and prepare them for the future challenges.To implement the above, Counselling Services are to be formalized which will enable the students to get over their social institutions and exclusivity, which are attributed to their socio-economic and cultural diversities and linguistic barriers. The career and counselling support that an institution offers to its students makes them confident to perform better. Counselling thus addresses both the academic and the career concerns and opportunities. The inculcation of guidance about market patterns and employability can help the institution in building a base for its students. This exercise will result in their socioeconomic integration.Career Counselling and Guidance Cell would help the students with appropriate guidance to establish linkages with the world of work and locate career opportunities vis- \u00e0-vis the realities and job profiles in the context of highly competitive emerging occupational patterns. The gap in perception about the market demands and individual expectations could be bridged through psychological and confidence building measures.Vocational guidance and campus based interviews have become a common practice. These could be taken care of through the active liaison of the Career and Counselling Cell with the recruiting agencies and HR personnel of reputed firms. The active participation of institutional experts from these could give greater on site experience in search of suitable candidates. In this exercise, the institutions, for positive help, could also involve their alumni. They could also undertake an affordable training programme to acquaint the students with the high demand market areas and invoke industry institution linkage.\u00a0Objective:Along with the academic and administrative processes in a College, Career and Counselling Cell has to be a dispensation of well-informed and interested teachers.It has to support the students in the development of soft skills and communication ability to challenge the rigors of competitive tests and on-job-training in add-on or vocational courses.As a purveyor of healthy inter and intra personal relations, it has to inculcate social values and ability to think independently for carrying out social responsibilities.There may be a team of teachers with different subjects and interests to create a homogeneous group to translate this vision and carry out its healthy functions as an institutional imperative.The guidance and counselling cell in a College has to be a resource centre of information, guidance and counselling with free accessibility and internet based global connectivity and exchange of information on professional placements.\u00a0Function of Career Counselling Cell:To gather information on job avenues and placements in different institutions and concerns related to the courses that the College offers.To analyse information in the local, regional and national contexts to explore its relevance and utility for the students in their placements and on-job training.To organise seminars and guidance workshops for informing students about the emerging professional trends and events, job profiles, leadership roles, entrepreneurship, market needs and risks and implementation of national socioeconomic policies and to impart training in soft skills. To promote discipline, healthy outlook and positive attitudes towards national integration and removal of narrow provincial preferences and prejudices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedbacks \n\n\n\nHear From Our Students \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCivility vicinity graceful is it at.

The individual achievements of faculty members are paramount to any educational institution\u2019s success, but the work that they do as members of RCOEM community is equally vital in creating the benefits that technical education brings to our society.We already accept this basic principle of collaboration. The value of a collaborative faculty leadership also extends to the learning experience of students, and, as with translational work and research collaboration, these efforts work best through interdisciplinary interactions such as team teaching, curriculum design and the innovative use of active learning pedagogies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nFACULTY SEARCH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWARDS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPARENTS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPUBLICATIONS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFACULTY LOGIN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSTAFF CREDIT COOPERATIVE SOCIETY\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Search\n\n\n\nAll \n\nAll\nPG ProgramsPhD ProgramUG Programs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Enquiry\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is 1 + 2 ?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Exposure\nRCOEM\u2019s industry collaboration ensure practical exposure for students. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture of Continuous Learning\nWe focus on research and innovation to create a culture of consistent learning. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced Faculty\nOur experienced faculties provide personalized attention to students.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-round development\nOur emphasis on co-curricular activities nurtures all-round development of students.\n \n\n\nIMPORTANT LINKSRight to Information\nStudents\nFaculty\nPhoto Gallery\nRegistrar Office\nMandatory Disclosure\nFinance Office\nProfessional Chapters\nExamination Cell\nCentral Library\nSRSS\nIQAC\nOTHER LINKSR&D Intranet Portal\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2016-21\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2022-27\nRCOEM C-RAFT\nARIIA 2021\nE.D.

To Start with, C-RAFT will currently focus on Adoption and Commercialization of Rural Technologies and looks towards the contribution from the faculty members with students in the form of rural based projects. Idea is to provide solutions to local problems and scale up to extrapolate the same at the global level making it to the internationally acceptable standards.C-RAFT looks forward to improve the living standards of the Rural and Urban Populace through contribution in technological domain useful for processes and products. C-RAFT has been designed to cater to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals envisioned by the United Nations and also to take forward the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat. C-RAFT aims to achieve these through technological interventions at all levels of the society per say. VisionC-RAFT envisions creation and implementation of suitable technologies towards fulfilling Sustainable Developmental Goals and Contributing to Atmanirbhar Bharat.PhilosophyC-RAFT strongly believes in inclusive development and will initially work on the Philosophy of D-I-D or Document \u2013 Improvise \u2013 Disseminate. C-RAFT will go to society, identify problem, design a solution based on the problem statement, document the design and if it is in crude form, improvise the design and finally disseminate and deploy the same. C-RAFT based on the success of the solutions will also replicate the same if need be to other areas with similar problems. C-RAFT also envisages technological grouping into interdisciplinary domain so as to create an effective work group directed towards the fulfillment of its vision. C-RAFT will identify future needs and will strive to develop technologies that will satiate the future needs of the generations to come. C-RAFT will initiate work into the following technology verticals:Appropriate Technologies based on Human powered drivesUser Interaction Design for Low LiteracyDigitization of Education under Education for ALL initiativeTackling Epidemics and PandemicsDefence TechnologiesElectric Autonomous VehiclesAI and MLObjectives of C-RAFTC-RAFT will work around the following 5 objectivesTo participate in Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) ActivitiesTo provide Socially acceptable and sustainable solutionsTo generate opportunities in Intrapreneurship for creating profit centres in the mentioned verticals and pave the way to Entrepreneurship after exploring the potential in a given verticalTo generate Intellectual Property and explore the opportunity to commercialize the sameTo collaborate with government and private agencies for joint projects contributing to the SDGs and Atmanirbhar BharatTo improvise and replicate solutions to meet international standardsRoadmapC-RAFT intends to achieve the aforementioned objectives through creation of technologies and intellectual property that will fuel the next technology research and/or deployment. The development of C-RAFT will be in a Phased manner with the following phases:Incubation (Phase 1)\u00a0Define the C-RAFT IgnitionDefine Scope and Boundaries of C-RAFTIdentify Skills for Technology DevelopmentDevelop and Deploy Societal and Rural based ProjectsStart scouting for Government funded STEM and Non-STEM Projects Start the Incubation of other projectsDevelopment (Phase 2)Explore more actionable research that can be both, Localized and GlobalizedCreate ecosystem for Product DevelopmentGetting enough funds to carry out cyclical researchExplore the Commercialization of the technologies patented in Phase 1Scout for Latest Technology Trends and align C-RAFT philosophy accordinglyFollow up (Phase 3)Take a review of both the phasesReview Skills requirements as per the then current and future trendsReview Investments and ROI to take corrective action if anyGoals for the next 1 yearDeployment of atleast 5 Appropriate and Rural Technologies in the next 1 yearDevelopment of atleast 2 indigenous technologies that can be patented.Land atleast 3 government funded projects and Submit publications to reputed journalsSet up atleast 3 verticals  \nUBA\nUnnat Bharat AbhiyaanUBA-Grama-Sabha-report-RCOEM-26-01-2020Unnat-Bharat-Abhiyan-Progress\nReports\nReportsSTTP on Rural DevelopmentSTTP-on-Rural-Developmentfinal-press-note-AGRESARBroucher-2021-2\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Exposure\nRCOEM\u2019s industry collaboration ensure practical exposure for students. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture of Continuous Learning\nWe focus on research and innovation to create a culture of consistent learning. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced Faculty\nOur experienced faculties provide personalized attention to students.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-round development\nOur emphasis on co-curricular activities nurtures all-round development of students.\n \n\n\nIMPORTANT LINKSRight to Information\nStudents\nFaculty\nPhoto Gallery\nRegistrar Office\nMandatory Disclosure\nFinance Office\nProfessional Chapters\nExamination Cell\nCentral Library\nSRSS\nIQAC\nOTHER LINKSR&D Intranet Portal\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2016-21\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2022-27\nRCOEM C-RAFT\nARIIA 2021\nE.D.

To incorporate a big idea, we must begin somewhere, putting all our efforts and a piece of our soul into it. Just like a prism reflects one plain light into a broad spectrum of colours, it can also combine these colours into a white light. Hence, we, team ARCEON 22 aim to combine varied ideas and vague arts into one single ray of immense hard work which is what we call, Meraki, i.e a fabulous creation made by putting ourselves into it. This is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe doing something with soul, creativity, or love \u2014 when you put \u201csomething of yourself\u201d into what you\u2019re doing, whatever it may be.

Low to medium power valve amplifiers for frequencies below the microwaves were largely replaced by solid state amplifiers in the 1960s and 1970s.Until the invention of the transistor in 1947, most practical high-frequency electronic amplifiers were made using thermionic valves. The simplest valve (named as a diode because of two electrodes) was invented by John Ambrose Fleming while working for the Marconi Company in London in 1904. In 1906 Lee De Forest added a third electrode and invented the first electronic amplifying device, the triode, which he named the Audion. The first application of valve amplification was in the regeneration of long distance telephony signals. Later, valve amplification was applied to the \u2018wireless\u2019 market that began in the early 30\u2019s. In due course amplifiers for music and later television were also built using valves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TelephoneA telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.The term \u201ctelephone\u201d is derived from Greek: \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5 (t\u0113le, far) and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (ph\u014dn\u0113, voice), together meaning distant voice. In 1870s, two inventors Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both independently designed devices that could transmit speech electrically (the telephone). Both men rushed their respective designs to the patent office within hours of each other. Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone first. Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell entered into a famous legal battle over the invention of the telephone, which Bell won. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverhead ProjectorThe overhead projector: An overhead projector (OHP), like a film or slide projector, uses light to project an enlarged image on a screen, allowing the view of a small document or picture to be shared with a large audience. In the overhead projector, the source of the image is a page-sized sheet of transparent plastic film (also known as \u201cfoils\u201d or \u201ctransparencies\u201d) with the image to be projected either printed or hand-written/drawn. These are placed on the glass platen of the projector, which has a light source below it and a projecting mirror and lens assembly above it (hence, \u201coverhead\u201d). They were widely used in education and business before the advent of video projectors.French physicist Edmond Becquerel developed the first known overhead projection apparatus in 1853. It was demonstrated by French instrument maker and inventor Jules Duboscq in 1866. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideocassette recorderA videocassette recorder (VCR) or video recorder is an electromechanical device that records analog audio and video from broadcast television or other source on a removable, magnetic tape videocassette, and can play back the recording. Use of a VCR to record a television program to play back at a more convenient time is commonly referred to as timeshifting. VCRs can also play back prerecorded tapes. In the 1980s and 1990s, prerecorded videotapes were widely available for purchase and rental, and blank tapes were sold to make recordings. The history of the videocassette recorder follows the history of videotape recording in general.In 1953, Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan video tape recorder. In 1970, Philips developed a home video cassette format specially made for a TV station in 1970 and available on the consumer market in 1972. Philips named this format \u201cVideo Cassette Recording\u201d. In 1972, videocassettes of movies became available for home use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio cassette player/recorderAn audio cassette recorder, also known as a tape deck/ tape player/tape machine or simply a tape recorder, is a sound recording and reproduction device that records and plays back sounds usually using magnetic tape for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal by moving the tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape in proportion to the audio signal. Tape-recording devices include the reel-to-reel tape deck & the cassette deck, which uses a cassette for storage. The use of magnetic tape for sound recording originated around 1930 in Germany as paper tape with oxide lacquered to it. Prior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present-day magnetic tape recordings.Magnetic tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It was recording and re-recording audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. As of the first decade of the 21st century, analog magnetic tape has been largely replaced by digital rec. technologies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio SetIn radio communications, a radio receiver, also known as a receiver, a wireless or simply a radio, is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information carried by them to a usable form. The first radio receivers were only able to receive Morse code and even though the first radio broadcasts took place in 1906. Radio sets were implemented using vacuum tubes in early years. The first radio receivers invented by Guglielmo Marconi, Oliver Lodge and Alexander Popov in 1894-95 used a primitive radio wave detector called a coherer, invented in 1890 by Edouard Branly and improved by Lodge and Marconi. The coherer was a glass tube with metal electrodes at each end, with loose metal powder between the electrodes. It initially had a high resistance.When a radio frequency voltage was applied to the electrodes, its resistance dropped and it conducted electricity. In the receiver the coherer was connected directly between the antenna and ground. During initial years, most radio sets were homemade, so the use by the public was restricted. With the invention of the transistor in 1947 by the Bell Laboratories, it then became possible to produce small portable radios. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTV SetJohn Logie Baird was a Scottish inventor, electrical engineer, and innovator who demonstrated his working television in 1926. In his first attempts to develop a working television system, Baird experimented with the Nipkow disc. Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had invented this scanning disc system in 1884. Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow\u2019s patent \u201cthe master television patent\u201d. Nipkow\u2019s work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium. In 1928 the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission. TV is introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. By the early 2010s, flat-panel television incorporating liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, LED-backlit LCD technology largely replaced CRT and other display technologies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRheostat & DimmerstatDimmerstat is a continuously variable voltage auto- transformer. It is the most useful and effective device for stepless, breakless and continues control of a.c. voltage. It is an ideal controlling device for numerous applications in laboratories and in industrial & commercial fields. The basic dimmerstat is meant for operation of a nominal voltage of 240V a.c. and can give output voltage anywhere between 0 to 240V or up to 270V by a simple transformer action. Dimmertats are used for light control in auditoriums, hotels, restaurants, theatre stages, photo studious, verandahs, lobbies, conference halls, cinema houses and even in homes. In 1959, Joel S. Spira, invented a dimmer based on a diode and a tapped autotransformer, saving energy and allowing the dimmer to be installed in a standard electrical wallbox. The most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit continuously is to use a rheostat. It is basically used to adjust magnitude of current in a circuit by changing length.The word rheostat was coined about 1845 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, from the Greek \u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 rheos meaning \u201cstream\u201d, and -\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 -states (from \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 histanai, \u201d to set, to cause to stand\u201d) meaning \u201csetter, regulating device\u201d, which is a two-terminal variable resistor. The term \u201crheostat\u201d is becoming obsolete, with the general term \u201cpotentiometer\u201d replacing it. For low-power applications (<1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper. Where the rheostat must be rated for higher power (>1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator, with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE P Level InstrumentTo determine the elevation difference between two or more than two objects / stations, leveling instrument is required. Leveling operation helps us to know the gradient between the various objects. This information is essential in designing the alignments for road, rail-road, water supply line, sewer line and storm water lines, etc on the field. Leveling instrument is also useful in deciding and maintaining different levels during the construction activity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCathode Ray Oscilloscope with Function Generator & Frequency Counter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC/DC Voltage/ Current measuring instrument- Analog type \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gramophoneA phonograph, in its later forms also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or since the 1940s called a record player, is a device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc, called a \u201crecord\u201d. To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison. Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the gramophone, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zigzag groove around the record. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SextantA sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument that measures the angular distance between two visible objects. The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon for the purposes of celestial navigation. The estimation of this angle, the altitude, is known as sighting or shooting the object, or taking a sight. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical/aeronautical chart for example, sighting the Sun at noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate latitude. Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally; a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude. The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1731 by John Hadley (1682\u20131744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704\u20131749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727). In 1922, it was modified for aeronautical navigation by Portuguese navigator and naval officer Gago Coutinho. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CameraA camera is an optical instrument that captures a visual image. Cameras are sealed boxes (the body) with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually photographic film or a digital sensor). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. Lenses focus the light entering the camera, the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera, and a shutter mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light. The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, digital imaging, photographic printing. The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film, videography, and cinematography. The word \u201ccamera\u201d comes from camera obscura, which means \u201cdark chamber\u201d and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye. The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Search\n\n\n\nAll \n\nAll\nPG ProgramsPhD ProgramUG Programs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Enquiry\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is 8 x 2 ?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Exposure\nRCOEM\u2019s industry collaboration ensure practical exposure for students. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture of Continuous Learning\nWe focus on research and innovation to create a culture of consistent learning. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced Faculty\nOur experienced faculties provide personalized attention to students.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-round development\nOur emphasis on co-curricular activities nurtures all-round development of students.\n \n\n\nIMPORTANT LINKSRight to Information\nStudents\nFaculty\nPhoto Gallery\nRegistrar Office\nMandatory Disclosure\nFinance Office\nProfessional Chapters\nExamination Cell\nCentral Library\nSRSS\nIQAC\nOTHER LINKSR&D Intranet Portal\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2016-21\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2022-27\nRCOEM C-RAFT\nARIIA 2021\nE.D.

The programme started in year 2023 with the intake of 120 students. The curriculum of the programme is to set an equilibrium of Cosmic Powers based on Nature\u2019s Law within a dwelling structure. The curriculum broadly cover planning and construction of Apartment to Airport while Tower to Township as well as recreational places as per Sutra Mandala Siddhanta by Sthapatya Veda.Sthapatya Veda is the language of Architecture. It is the most ancient and complete system of architecture and city planning in accord with Natural Law, which takes into account the mathematics, yoga sutra, Quantum Physics and planetary and Earth Science.\u00a0The difference between Sthapatya Veda and Vastu Shastra is One is Engineering, the other is Science. Engineering is the applied aspect, Science is the theoretical aspect. The term Sthapatya Veda refers to the is the applied aspect of this precious knowledge, while the term Vastu refers to the theoretical aspect.\u00a0Veda\u00a0means knowledge, and\u00a0Sthapan\u00a0means to establish. Therefore as we already mentioned,\u00a0Sthapatya Veda\u00a0is the Science of Architecture. Sthapatya Veda is the knowledge of application and skills.\nKey Features\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0903 \u0938\u0943\u091c\u0924\u093f \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u0939\u0930\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e\u0903 \u0964\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0935\u0936\u0917\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u094b \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0935\u0936\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u0903 \u0964\u0964The above lines mean that Time creates material objects of nature.

They are in need of an outlet to express their emotions. This is where a student Counseling Cell comes into picture. The most common issues faced by students are related to time management, stress management, peer pressure, procrastination, body language, communication skills etc. One-to-one counseling sessions with the student counselor helps our students to sort out these issues and unburden themselves of their problems. Also Counseling helps to monitor and meet the academic and welfare activities of students.ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES:By making the sessions light and interactive, the student counselor creates a conducive environment for the students to facilitate effective communication. Counseling helps the students concentrate better on their studies without getting emotionally drained by other issues. The academic and welfare activities of students belonging to physically challenged, women and other weaker sections are properly looked into by this cell.Services offered:Need based CounselingAcademic CounselingWelfare ServicesGrievance Redressa;Any other matter related to students welfare. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Exposure\nRCOEM\u2019s industry collaboration ensure practical exposure for students. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture of Continuous Learning\nWe focus on research and innovation to create a culture of consistent learning. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced Faculty\nOur experienced faculties provide personalized attention to students.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-round development\nOur emphasis on co-curricular activities nurtures all-round development of students.\n \n\n\nIMPORTANT LINKSRight to Information\nStudents\nFaculty\nPhoto Gallery\nRegistrar Office\nMandatory Disclosure\nFinance Office\nProfessional Chapters\nExamination Cell\nCentral Library\nSRSS\nIQAC\nOTHER LINKSR&D Intranet Portal\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2016-21\nRCOEM Perspective Plan 2022-27\nRCOEM C-RAFT\nARIIA 2021\nE.D.
